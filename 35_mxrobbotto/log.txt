DISCO:
- I had to tell it to initialize the database tables. but after that the database worked fine.
- I needed to tell it to create a user friendly way of accessing edit.
- oh cool it just works nicely.
- i am not taking its sqlite file suggestions

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
- the first one was actually a functioning webpage. Every other attempt was just to add another feature.
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
- it doesn't play well with sql
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?
- well it was definitely faster
