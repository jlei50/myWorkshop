# Notes:
Use 
    .headers on
    .mode column

Check if table exists with 
    c.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='courses'").fetchall() == []
   
Execute commands with a cursor.
   You also commit with the cursor.
   
To insert values:
    command = f"INSERT INTO students VALUES (?,?,?)"
    val = (student['name'], student['age'], student['id'])
    c.execute(command, val)
