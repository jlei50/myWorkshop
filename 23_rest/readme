json files are can be indexed nicely with the length of the relevant section (:

They can be passed into the html with jinja variables.

DISCO: Pulling content from JSON files works very similarly to that of dictionary but there's a lot more embedded that you can pull from just saying [0][..][...][...] instead of using multiple embedded dictionaries. The method for rendering the page and using the key and JSON file is also almost similar to GET/POST and sessions which we used for logins.

QCCs:

    In what other ways can you structure/format json files (arrays, lists, etc.)?
    What if the json files are mistructured, out of order, some in lists, other not; how can you use it in your code then? Do you have to manually fix those or can you use python?
    How does json work for really large files, packed with data to lessen slowness?
