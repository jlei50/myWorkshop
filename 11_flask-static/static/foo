Q: What happens when you access this file
     via
      http://localhost:5000/static/foo 
     ?
     
Needs to be foo.html or it just downloads foo.

NOTA BENE:
 Keep yourself honest by
   jotting down or verbalizing
     to your neighbourhood Devos+Duckies your prediction
       --- BEFORE you run your test.
    - the app.route("/static/foo.html") should mean that putting it at the end of the local host will load that function h(), displaying a random number
